# django-react-website
Repo with Django/MongoDB back-end and ReactJS front-end.

Based off of the [tutorial series by Traversy Media](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLillGF-RfqbbRA-CIUxlxkUpbq0IFkX60)
The back-end stuff needs to be reworked:
* Any directories with the word "lead" needs to be renamed, as well as any calls to those directories
** `leadmanager/leadmanager/settings.py` has the most calls to other directories

* "Lead" model (in `leadmanager/leads/models.py` need to be replaced with models for food drive and user event locations
* Need to change
